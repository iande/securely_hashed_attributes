In response to Aaron Patterson's request for a `has_secure_password`
implementation that uses Rails 3.1's new `serialize` features, I'm creating
this gem.

My primary goal is to actually work this functionality into Rails itself
as a replacement to `has_secure_password`, but why not make a gem of it
first?

Blah blah, etc, etc.  I'll write more when there's more to write about.

There's nothing to see here right now, come back later.
